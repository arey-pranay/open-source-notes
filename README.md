# open-source-notes
Here I’m posting the rough notes I made from the Open-Source Contributions playlist by Piyush Garg, learned a lot through it. The lectures are around 7 hours long, if you increase the speed and also keep doing all the exercises, you can easily complete it in 10 hrs, it’ll be worth it.
